Description: Computes the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for task 
    functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Also includes functions
    for constructing a design matrix from task fMRI event timings, and for
    comparing multiple design matrices in a general linear model (GLM). A
    wrapper function is provided for GLM analysis of CIFTI-format data. Lastly,
    there are supporting functions which provide visual summaries of the
    HRFs and design matrices.
